## Hi there 👋

I'm **[Rines](https://github.com/RinesTech)** — an aspiring developer who dreams big and builds bigger.

I love creating things out of my imagination and turning ideas into real projects.  
Cats, online games, and coding are my comfort zone.

Always learning. Always building. Always exploring. 🚀
